# Chapter 3: ROS 2 Architecture Deep Dive

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) architecture, focusing on its core concepts: nodes, topics, services, and actions. We will explore how these components facilitate communication and coordination in robotic systems, particularly for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2: nodes, topics, services, and actions.
- Differentiate between topics (publish/subscribe), services (request/reply), and actions (goal/cancel/feedback/result).
- Implement basic ROS 2 nodes in Python using `rclpy`.
- Design communication patterns between ROS 2 nodes for humanoid control.

## 3.1 Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions

ROS 2 is a middleware framework that enables communication between different processes (nodes) in a robotic system. It provides four primary communication mechanisms:

- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform computation. Nodes are the basic unit of computation in ROS 2.
- **Topics**: A publish/subscribe communication pattern for streaming data (e.g., sensor data, actuator commands).
- **Services**: A request/reply communication pattern for single requests and responses (e.g., changing a robot's mode).
- **Actions**: A goal-oriented communication pattern for long-running tasks with feedback (e.g., navigating to a location).

```python
# Example of a simple ROS 2 publisher node (non-interactive for now)
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalPublisher(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World: %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
    minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
