# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: A Complete Textbook for Building Embodied Intelligent Systems

## Book Overview

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," a comprehensive textbook designed to guide students and practitioners through the fascinating world of embodied intelligence. This textbook takes you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations, providing hands-on experience with real humanoid systems using only open tools.

This textbook is structured as four progressive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System** - Learn ROS 2 architecture and fundamentals
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin** - Master simulation environments with Gazebo and Isaac Sim
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain** - Explore Isaac ROS, locomotion, and manipulation
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action & Conversational Humanoids** - Build complete AI systems

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this textbook, you will be able to:

- Build, simulate, and control a humanoid using only open tools
- Train and deploy a Vision-Language-Action model on a real Jetson-powered robot
- Complete the full capstone project: "Pick up the red cup" from a single spoken command
- Understand the complete pipeline from perception to action in embodied systems
- Apply state-of-the-art techniques in robotics, AI, and human-robot interaction

## Purpose of the Textbook

This textbook serves as a complete educational resource for upper-undergraduate to master's students in computer science, robotics, and mechanical/electrical engineering. It's also valuable for industry engineers entering the field of Physical AI and for researchers looking to understand the complete pipeline of humanoid robotics development.

The content is designed to be practical, with every concept accompanied by runnable code examples, simulation environments, and real-world applications. Our approach emphasizes hands-on learning with real tools that are used in both academic research and industry applications.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey by exploring Module 1, where you'll establish the foundational ROS 2 architecture that powers all subsequent modules. Each chapter includes learning objectives, hands-on exercises, and programming projects to reinforce your understanding.

The textbook includes interactive code blocks that can be executed directly in your browser, comprehensive documentation for all provided ROS 2 workspaces, and step-by-step guides for setting up simulation and real-robot environments.
