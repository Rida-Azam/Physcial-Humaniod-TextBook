3. **15+ ROS 2 Workspaces** with runnable examples
4. **URDF Models** for humanoid robots
5. **Simulation Environments** (Gazebo and Isaac Sim)
6. **Navigation2 Stack** for humanoid robots
7. **RL Walking Policies** using Isaac Gym
8. **Perception Pipeline** with VSLAM and object detection
9. **Capstone Project** with voice-to-action pipeline
10. **Instructor Resources** with solutions and slides

## Technical Standards Met

- ✅ Interactive code blocks via Thebe/Starlark
- ✅ ROS 2 Jazzy with Isaac Sim 2024.1+
- ✅ All content in MDX format with exercises and projects
- ✅ Dark mode, search, mobile-friendly interface
- ✅ Citation workflow (Zotero → BetterBibTeX → APA 7th)
- ✅ Plagiarism check (0% tolerance) and fact verification
- ✅ Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 10-12 compliance
- ✅ Docker/DevContainer for reproducible environment

## Success Criteria Achieved
- ✅ Student can build, simulate, and control humanoid using open tools
- ✅ Student can train/deploy VLA model on Jetson-powered robot
- ✅ Student can complete "Pick up the red cup" capstone project
- ✅ Zero plagiarism, all code runs, deployed site fully functional
- ✅ Includes 3 complete humanoid projects
- ✅ Ready for external review by robotics professor

## Repository Structure
